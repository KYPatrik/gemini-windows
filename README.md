# Gemini Desktop App

A native Windows desktop application wrapper for Google Gemini AI, providing a standalone app experience for accessing Gemini without opening a web browser.

## üéØ Purpose

This application transforms the Google Gemini web interface into a native Windows desktop application using Electron. Instead of opening Gemini in a browser tab, you can run it as a standalone app with its own icon, window, and taskbar presence - just like any other native Windows application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Native Desktop Experience**: Run Gemini as a dedicated Windows application
- **Custom Branding**: Uses custom Gemini icons for the window and taskbar
- **Direct Integration**: Loads the official Gemini website directly - no proxy or modified code
- **Secure Authentication**: Safe to log in with your Google account (same security as using Chrome/Edge)
- **Isolated Environment**: Runs in its own window separate from your browser
- **Always Accessible**: Quick access from your desktop or Start menu

## üîí Security

This application is safe to use with your Google account because:
- It loads the official `https://gemini.google.com/app/` directly

- No intermediate code intercepts your data
- Employs security best practices (`contextIsolation`, `nodeIntegration: false`)
